## use this link to share you folder where the images are saved on Google Drive
## Replace the your_folder_id with the folder_id on your Google Drive 
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/your_folder_id?usp=sharing

## Where I got my code from
https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_signup_form_modal

## Also, Should create two folders 
|_Submitted_Images
|_Approved_Images

your code will only get images from the approved folder. 
Someone will need to manually view the Submitted_Images and move them to Approved so they get picked up in the image rotator. 
Once someone submits an image, a message should be displayed that says "Thank You! Your image will be approved within 24-48 hours."
